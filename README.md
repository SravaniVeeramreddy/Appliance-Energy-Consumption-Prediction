# Appliance-Energy-Consumption-Prediction
This project predicts total energy usage based on sensor and time-series data using regression models. After preprocessing and feature engineering, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting are trained and evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics.
